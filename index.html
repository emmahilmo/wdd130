            <p>Utah is a state in western United States. Salt Lake City is the state capital. It is the headquarters
            to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS Church).<br>It is a major tourist destination for outside
            activities such as hiking and skiiing. Utah's nickname is the beehive state. The state bird is California gull
            and the state flower is the sego lily.<br> Utah is bordered by Idaho and Wyoming in the north, Colorado in the east,
            Arizona in the south and Nevada in the west. Something cool is in the southeastern corner, Utah touches Colorado,
            New Mexico and Arizona.<br> That section is called the four corners and is the only place in the country where four
            states come together. Utah is known for our moutains. They are called the Rocky Mountains.
