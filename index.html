            <p>Hello! My name is Emma Hilmo. I live in Utah, USA and have lived here my whole life. I'm the
            second oldest and have 5 siblings and the only girl in a family of 5 boys. I am 21 years old. 
            I'm currently working on getting my Associates Degree in Advanced Technology and certificates in graphic 
            design and web design. I am currently working full time at Lakeview Academy. The program I work in is called
            the Space Center. Most people reading this will probably not know what the Space Center is. You can come and
            do space missions. You get a group together, and fly a spaceship. It's like you get to be in your own movie. 
            and you have to complete it. We give you a missions to complete and then you go onto a spaceship. You get your own
            job to control the spaceship. We do this for the kids that go to the school. They get to come four times in a 
            school year and we add their curriculum into the mission. We also do it for after school and people that want
            to come and fly a mission.
            </p>

            <p>Utah is a state in western United States. Salt Lake City is the state capital. It is the headquarters
            to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS Church).<br>It is a major tourist destination for outside
            activities such as hiking and skiiing. Utah's nickname is the beehive state. The state bird is California gull
            and the state flower is the sego lily.<br> Utah is bordered by Idaho and Wyoming in the north, Colorado in the east,
            Arizona in the south and Nevada in the west. Something cool is in the southeastern corner, Utah touches Colorado,
            New Mexico and Arizona.<br> That section is called the four corners and is the only place in the country where four
            states come together. Utah is known for our moutains. They are called the Rocky Mountains.
